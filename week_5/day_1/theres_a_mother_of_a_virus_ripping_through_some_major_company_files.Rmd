# Homework Info

## Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

## Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

## Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

# MVP

## Part 1

**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(CodeClanData)
library(janitor)
library(wesanderson)
revenue <- clean_names(qb_revenue_breakdown)
```

```{r}
ggplot(revenue) +
  aes(x = year, y = revenue, fill = product) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest2")) +
  theme_classic()
```



**Question 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>

```{r}
monthly_sales <- clean_names(qb_monthly_sales) %>% 
  filter(cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(monthly_sales) +
  aes(x = date, y = amount) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "revenue") +
  scale_x_date("Date", date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%y") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
<br>

```{r}
monthly_sales <- clean_names(qb_monthly_sales) %>% 
  filter(cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(monthly_sales) +
  aes(x = date, y = amount, colour = cashflow) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date("Date", date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%y") +
  labs(y = "revenue") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>

```{r}
competitors <- clean_names(qb_competitors)

ggplot(competitors) +
  aes(x = year, revenue, fill = company) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  geom_area() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling2"))
```


**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(competitors) +
  aes(year, revenue, colour = company) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme)
  theme_minimal()
```


**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>


```{r}
device <- clean_names(qb_device_data)

ggplot(device) +
  aes(decimal_hour, counts, group = id, colour = device) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(id ~ device) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  theme_qb
 

```



## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```
<br>

# Extension

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
<br>
