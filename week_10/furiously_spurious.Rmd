```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
manage <- read_csv("data/project_management.csv")
```

```{r}
manage %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(estimated_length, actual_length) +
  geom_point()
  
```



```{r}
manage %>% 
  summarise(cor(estimated_length, actual_length))
```

this shows a strong linear correlation between our estimated length and actual length

```{r}
model <- lm(formula = actual_length ~ estimated_length, data = manage)
```


```{r}
glance(model)
```

the variation in the predicted length explains about 65 percent of the variation in the actual length.
since we are aiming at a predictive model, this number could be drastically improved.

```{r}
autoplot(model)
```

there are no issues with these plots so we conclude that the assumptions for linear regression are satisfied

the p-value is far less than 0.05 so we can say that the regression model is statistically significant at 
the 95% confidence level.
